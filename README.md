# Seismic Activity Prediction using ML
<br>
📌 Project Overview<br>
This project focuses on predicting earthquake magnitudes using machine learning.
<br>
We used synthetic dataset and applied regression techniques to build a predictive model.
<br>
The aim of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can assist in natural disaster risk assessment by forecasting the magnitude of future earthquakes based on past data.
